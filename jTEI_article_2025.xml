        <p><q>Can the archives of an email list be stored in TEI?</q> This seems
        like a reasonable question, to which the answer, especially with the new
        <title level="a">Computer-mediated Communcation</title> chapter of the
        <title>TEI Guidelines</title>, should be a simple <q>yes</q>.</p>
        <p>In order to prove this, each co-author attempted to encode a subset
        of the archives of <ref target="https://lists.psu.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=TEI-L">TEI-L</ref>,
        the main email discussion list for TEI, in TEI. While our methods were wildly different,
        our conclusions are similar: the answer is <q>yes, but it is a <emph>lot</emph> harder
        than you might expect</q>.</p>

          This is an example of how to do a bibliographic citation:
          <ref type="bibl" target="#bloggs13">Bloggs 2013</ref> tells us...
          This paragraph should be deleted as soon as we have a bibl cit we
          can use as our own xmp.

          <item>we had recently been working with it (to move from Brown to PSU)</item>
        </list>
        <p>Our initial thought was that converting the data to XML would be easy,
          and that most of our attention would be directed towards the more interesting
          part of deciding exactly how to encode it in TEI. However, it turns
          out that both parts were problematic — it was very difficult to convert
          the data into XML, and in several cases there is no TEI encoding that is
          really satisfactory.</p>
        <p>Our two approaches were
          <list>
            <item>an automated conversion of mass data to a basic
            TEI representation for archiving and potential later
            enhancement</item>
            <item>a craft encoding of a short range of months or
            years worth of posts</item>
          </list>
        </p>

        <head>Conversion from source to XML</head>
       <div xml:id="mass-conversion"> 
         <head>Mass conversion approach</head>
        <p>Our goal for the mass conversion approach was to convert all of TEI-L
          from its inception up to 2024-04-29. That end date was chosen because it was
          the day the mailing list was moved from Brown University’s
          LISTSERV to Penn State University’s LISTSERV. Thus we were able to obtain the entire dataset
          directly from Brown listmaster without needing to worry about merging in data from
          PSU or about posts made just after we obtained the data. The Brown listmaster sent
          us 412 separate files, one for each month, i.e.,
          <name>tei-l.log9001</name> through <name>tei-l.log2404</name>.
        </p>
        <p>Step 1 was thus to rename the log files to use 4-digit (as opposed to 2-digit) years
        so that they sorted into the correct order.</p>
        <div xml:id="characters_illegal">
          <head>Illegal characters (for XML)</head>
          <p>Early e-mail systems used ASCII (7-bit) characters only. Thus
            there were 128 available code points (0–2⁷-1, or 0–127). Of those
            128 available code points, only 99 of them are legal XML characters.
            The remaining 29 characters (for which see <ptr type="crossref" target="#appendix01"/>)
            are all non-printing control characters, intended for controlling
            the behavior of a peripheral device such as a paper tape or printer, or (in a few cases)
            whitespace. While neither of us is an expert on early e-mail systems, we suspect
            that the designers never intended these characters 
            to be used in e-mail, but did not feel it necessary to do anything
            to prevent them from being used, as the average user of a computer
            had no way of generating them.</p>
          <p>However, of the 29 characters that are not legal in XML, 17 of them occur in the TEI-L
            archives:
            <list>
              <item>64 occurrences in 34 posts before 2000 (which not surprising)</item>
              <item>38 occurrences in 11 posts after 2008 (which we did not expect)</item>
            </list>
            These characters were generally used to not to represent the control characters 
            to which they are mapped in the ASCII character set, but rather to represent
            various accented characters that were not part of the original (7-bit) ASCII set.
            The last use of a character that is illegal in XML was on 2016-03-13.</p>
